                    <h2>Rowan Vale - Engineering Business Growth</h2>
                    <p>I'm a software engineer with 4 years of experience building scalable, mission-critical systems in C#/.NET. I started as a DevOps Engineer, moved into a Tech Lead role, and now work as an Architect on a large-scale government project, designing backend services, mentoring developers, and making sure the systems I build actually hold up under real-world pressure.</p>
                    <p>Outside of enterprise work, I spend a lot of time in Unity and Three.js building real-time 3D applications, everything from multiplayer combat games to physics simulations. I'm drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of software architecture, real-time systems, and interactive design. Whether that's architecting a CI/CD pipeline that cuts deployment from 4 hours to 15 minutes, or wiring up WebSocket state sync for a multiplayer game, I care about building things that work well and are built to last.</p>
